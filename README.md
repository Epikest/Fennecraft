# Fennecraft

Terms of usage:

To reflect briefly on my terms of service for Fennecraft, I support use of my modpack where there is no financial link to the access to implementations of the modpack.
This means that personal private use or open public use is allowed, however I do not approve of using the pack in a way that players must pay for entry in some way,
be it a time commitment or monetary commitment. Verification is fine, but it should not require a user to pay significantly with their time or money.

Fennecraft is a passion project I made using my personal time, and I would hate to see it paywalled for commercial gain. By using this modpack you agree to these terms:
 - Whilst I am not affiliated with adam98991, I have received permission from him via discord to distribute this pack on Curseforge.
 - This does not include permission to publicly distribute a server-pack. Please consult with him if you wish to make a fork of MC Eternal.
 - As I do not own many of the quest and shop assets within the pack, I therefore cannot give permission for redistribution.
 - You cannot create a fork of this pack without obtaining permission to fork MC Eternal first.
 - Custom assets and textures contained within the pack are not open for redistribution unless stated otherwise by me.
 - I reserve the right to cease distribution of the pack at any time.
 - I do not approve of commercial use of my pack, including pay-2-play.
 - All uses of my pack must either be public to access, or private between select individuals. All mods belong to their respected mod owners.
